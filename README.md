w. Analyzing and
Identifying the hidden crime patterns are the major problems to the police department as there
are voluminous data of crime exist. So, we need some methodologies to help the investigation
bureau in solving the crimes. Machine Learning approach provides regression and
classification techniques that helps us to serve the purpose. Regression techniques like Multilinear regression, is a statistical method which is used to find the relationship between two
quantitative variables. This predicts the value of the dependent variables(y) based on the
independent variables(x). Classification techniques like K-Neighbors Classification is used to
classify the multiclass target variables. Neural networks are then used to improve the
accuracy of the predictions, which has an input layer, dense layer and an output layer. Based
on these algorithms the perpetrator description like age, sex and relationship with the victim
is predicted
